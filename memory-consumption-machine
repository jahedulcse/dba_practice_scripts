-------------Step 1: Query for PGA Memory Usage by Machine

SELECT 
    s.machine,
    ROUND(SUM(p.pga_used_mem)/1024/1024, 2) AS total_pga_used_mem_MB,
    ROUND(SUM(p.pga_alloc_mem)/1024/1024, 2) AS total_pga_alloc_mem_MB,
    ROUND(SUM(p.pga_freeable_mem)/1024/1024, 2) AS total_pga_freeable_mem_MB,
    ROUND(SUM(p.pga_max_mem)/1024/1024, 2) AS total_pga_max_mem_MB
FROM 
    v$process p,
    v$session s
WHERE 
    p.addr = s.paddr
    AND s.username IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    s.machine
ORDER BY 
    total_pga_used_mem_MB DESC;

--------------- Step 2: Query for SGA Memory Usage

SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(value)/1024/1024, 2) AS total_sga_size_MB
FROM 
    v$sga;
---------------
SELECT 
    i.HOST_NAME,
    s.INST_ID, 
    ROUND(SUM(s.value)/1024/1024, 2) AS total_sga_size_MB
FROM 
    gv$sga s
JOIN 
    gv$instance i
    ON s.INST_ID = i.INSTANCE_NUMBER
GROUP BY 
    i.HOST_NAME, s.INST_ID
ORDER BY 
    total_sga_size_MB DESC;


--------------------------

------------Step 3: Combine the Results
Since SGA is constant for each instance, you can manually add it to the PGA results per machine. There isn't a built-in query that directly adds these up by machine across all instances. However, 
you can do this calculation manually by summing up the results from the above two queries.

Example Calculation:
Run the PGA query to get the PGA memory per machine.
Run the SGA query on each instance to get the SGA size.
Sum the PGA and SGA values for each machine.
Notes:
SGA Memory: SGA is shared for the entire instance, so it needs to be added once per instance.
PGA Memory: PGA is specific to each process and session, so it varies by machine.
By combining these two, you can get an approximate total memory usage per machine in your Oracle database environment.


---------

Oracle does not inherently provide a machine-wise breakdown of SGA memory usage because the SGA (System Global Area) is a shared memory structure that is specific to each database instance rather than to individual machines or processes. However, 
you can find out the total SGA size for each instance, and if your environment has multiple instances running on different machines, you can correlate the instance with its machine.
