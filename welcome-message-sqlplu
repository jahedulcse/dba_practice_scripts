##### Setup glogin.sql in Oracle
### Open the glogin.sql file

vi $ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin/glogin.sql

### Put below query at the end of the file

select 'Welcome, you are connected to '||name||' database' "Hello" from v$database;

Save and close. That's it, now whenever you login to SQL*PLUS, you will be greeted with a nice welcome message!

I would like to display below message every time a user logs into the database

Hello
-----------------------------------------------
Welcome, You are connected to TESTDB database
