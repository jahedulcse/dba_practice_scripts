######### Check archive log size
######Check archive generation size via below query

select to_char(COMPLETION_TIME,'DD-MON-YYYY') Arch_Date,count(*) No#_Logs,
sum((BLOCKS*512)/1024/1024/1024) Arch_LogSize_GB 
from v$archived_log 
where to_char(COMPLETION_TIME,'DD-MON-YYYY')>=trunc(sysdate-7) and DEST_ID=1
group by to_char(COMPLETION_TIME,'DD-MON-YYYY')
order by to_char(COMPLETION_TIME,'DD-MON-YYYY');

Let us assume the average archive log files size generated per day is 5 GB. Your application team wants you to enable
FLASHBACK for 4 days. In this case you will need Approx 20 GB (5GB X 4Days) of space for flashback logs.

##########Estimate flashback destination size
Sometimes application team will ask DBA to enable flashback for x number of days. In such case, a DBA needs to estimate the
flashback space required for x number of days in order to store the flashback logs. The flashback log size is same as archive
log size generated in a database.

Method to estimate flashback space 

Check archive log size 


Method to estimate flashback space
---------------
Check the archive generation size via below query
Take the average per day size of archives generated
Multiply the average archive size with x number of days
Ask storage team to add the required space for flashback file system
